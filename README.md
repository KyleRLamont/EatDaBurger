## Organization: 
The app is organized as-
1. HTML in handlebars to build and change the page based on the users interaction with the database.
2. Express routing to send and receive information to the database.
3. ORM scripting to make Routing easier and less prone to error.

## Using the App: 
To use the app, simply click Devour! button next to the burger. This will call it to move to the right side of the screen. You can then enter another burger in the submit field below and click submit. This adds it on the left above to be devoured. Congratulations!


## Technologies Used:
